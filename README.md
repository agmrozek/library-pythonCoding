| Syntax Element       | Explanation                                          | Example Code Snippet                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Variables            | Containers for storing data                           | `name = "John"`                                               |
| Conditionals         | Execute different blocks of code based on conditions  | ```python if x > 5:     print("x is greater than 5") else:     print("x is less than or equal to 5")``` |
| Loops                | Repeatedly execute a block of code                    | ```python for i in range(5):     print(i)```                  |
| Functions            | Reusable blocks of code                               | ```python def greet(name):     print("Hello, " + name)```     |
| Classes              | Blueprints for creating objects                       | ```python class Dog:     def __init__(self, name):         self.name = name```                           |
| Imports              | Including external modules or packages                | ```python import math```                                       |
| Exception Handling   | Catching and handling errors                          | ```python try:     x = 10 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError:     print("Cannot divide by zero")``` |
| Boolean Operators    | Logical operations                                   | ```python x = True and False```                                |
| Math Operators       | Perform arithmetic operations                         | ```python x = 5 + 3```                                         |
| Comparison Operators | Compare values or conditions                          | ```python x == y```                                            |
| Comprehensions       | Concise way to create lists, dictionaries, or sets    | ```python squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]```            |
