Basic syntax: Start with learning the basic syntax of Python. 
This includes understanding how to declare variables, use conditionals 
(if-else statements), loops, functions, and data types like strings, 
numbers, lists, and dictionaries.

Comments: Learn how to write comments in your code. Comments are lines 
of text that are not executed by the interpreter but help to explain what 
the code is doing.

Input and output: Learn how to take input from the user using the input() 
function and display output using the print() function.

Control flow: Understand how to control the flow of your program using 
control structures like if-else statements, loops, and conditional expressions.

Functions: Learn how to create and use functions. Functions are reusable 
blocks of code that perform a specific task.

Libraries: Explore the vast range of Python libraries available for various 
purposes, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

File handling: Learn how to read from and write to files using the file 
handling functions in Python.

Exception handling: Learn how to handle errors and exceptions in 
your program using try-except blocks.

Classes and objects: Learn about object-oriented programming and how 
to define classes and create objects in Python.

Debugging: Learn how to debug your code using debugging tools like print 
statements, Python debugger (pdb), or using a graphical debugger like PyCharm.
